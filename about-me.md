# About Me

I come from a non-traditional IT background, originally working in supply chain operations, but I've independently developed the skills to build secure, observable, and automated infrastructure from the ground up.

I think like an attacker but build like a defender always striving to find the right balance between security and operational functionality. I believe that true security is not just about blocking threats, but about understanding how systems behave, how attackers think and how users work.

## ⚙️ What I Bring

- 🔍 **Red-Team Mindset with Blue-Team Execution**  
  I approach infrastructure design from the perspective of an adversary, but engineer defenses that are proactive, layered, and stealth-aware.

- 📈 **Observability Focused**  
  I care about knowing *what’s happening, when, and why*. From stealth log aggregation to anomaly detection and real-time alerts, I make sure systems speak before they scream.

- 🔐 **Security-First, but Usability-Aware**  
  I build hardened environments that are still workable for developers and users. That includes safe defaults, automated workflows, and reversible deployments.

- 🧩 **Structured, Modular Automation**  
  I use Ansible with OS-aware roles, templated systemd services, and clean repo architecture making infrastructure reproducible and easy to transfer.

- 🤝 **Mentoring and Knowledge Sharing**  
  I document what I build so others can follow. This project is as much about teaching as it is about engineering.

- 🛠️ **Persistence & Ownership**  
  I’ve handled setbacks, debugging, tuning, and testing not because someone told me to, but because it needed to be done right.

## 🎯 My Goal

To build a living, real-world infrastructure example and not just a lab but a system that evolves like an organism: intelligent, adaptive, secure where it must be, and functional wherever it can be.

My mission is to help others reach that same level of insight and resilience, by showing what’s possible when you combine deep curiosity with a security-first mindset.

Whether it becomes a service, a platform, or a toolset this is my blueprint for what infrastructure *should* be.
