# 📁 Examples

This folder contains selected playbooks and configuration files that illustrate the structure and style used in this infrastructure project.

They are **not complete deployments**, but rather carefully chosen examples that show:

- How configuration is structured (e.g. OS-aware, modular)
- How security-conscious defaults are applied
- How Ansible and shell scripts are used together
- How clarity and maintainability are prioritized

---

## ✳️ Why not include everything?

This project includes many internal scripts and playbooks that are still evolving or highly environment-specific.  
To keep things clear, focused, and professional, only a subset of files is shared publicly.
